I decided to create this project to learn more about React. When I came across Clement's visualizer https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer-Tutorial, I was inspired to make my own.

For now, the plan is to complete the sorting algorithms, and move on to more complicated algorithms after that.
